<p>komgo is an Open Financing Platform designed to efficiently and securely connect finance providers and commodity traders. It can be easily integrated with smart contract and other platforms to provide a complete network-based trading platform that empowers the entire commodity ecosystem.</p>

<p>The platform achieves this through the the following key capabilities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>User Administration</strong><br />
User administration allows organisations to manage platform users to ensure people are only able to perform the actions they are authorised to perform.</p>

    <p>komgo gives organisations the ability to define their own roles to reflect the organisation’s own operations, and to manage how these roles are assigned to users.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Counterparty Management</strong><br />
Counterparty management allows komgo users to manage the other organisations with whom they interact on the platform (counterparties).</p>

    <p>komgo enables organisations to “request” to connect with other organisations on the platform; similar to a facebook friend request.</p>

    <p>Counterparty management is critical to ensuring that sensitive information is only sent to organisation (counterparties) with whom your organisation has agreed to share information.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Know Your Customer (KYC)</strong><br />
KYC processes ensures that an organisation can verify the identity of any client with whom the organisation interacts before the business relationship starts.</p>

    <p>komgo simplifies this process for all parties involved by providing a secure document management system the enables parties to seamlessly and securely share the documents required for KYC on a peer-to-peer basis.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Trade Finance</strong><br />
The Trade Finance feature facilitates both processes for applying for financing, and the subsequent issuing and sharing of the resulting instrument.</p>

    <p>komgo simplifies this process for all parties by providing a secure manner for commodities traders to share the documentation required for a finance application. After acceptance thereof, komgo enables the issuing bank to create the financing instrument on the platform, and securely share it with all the relevant stakeholders.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
